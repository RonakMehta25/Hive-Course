Bucketing

Basically, the concept of Hive Partitioning provides a way of segregating hive table data into multiple files/directories. However, it only gives effective results in few scenarios. Such as:

– When there is the limited number of partitions.
– Or, while partitions are of comparatively equal size.

Syntax is cluster by 

we can use sorting with bucketing which can help in joins

we can not directly load bucketed tables with LOAD DATA (LOCAL) INPATH command, similar to partitioned tables. Instead to populate the bucketed tables we need to use INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE … SELECT …FROM clause from another table. 


Hence, we will create one temporary table in hive with all the columns in input file from that table we will copy into our target bucketed table for this.

set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;

set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict; (strict implies that atleast 1 static partition needs to be mentioned)

Number of reduce task is equal to the number of buckets
