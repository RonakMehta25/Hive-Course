Views and partioned Views in Hive

We can create View in Hive like

Create View View_Name as select ....


We can also create partitioned view in Hive

 CREATE VIEW log_view PARTITIONED ON (pagename,year,month,day) AS SELECT uid,properties,pagename, year,month,day FROM log; 


partition columns must be last in select statement query.
